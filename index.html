<h1>Leveraging comparative genomics and phylogenetics to understand evolutionary radiations</h1>

<p><font size="3.5">I'm a postdoctoral associate in <u><a href="http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/">Chris Martin's</a></u> lab at UC Berkeley, studying the genomic basis of fitness differences underlying an adaptive radiation of pupfish habitat specialists. Broadly speaking, my research is focused on hybridization, diversification, and and their intersection. I'm particularly interested in both adaptive and non-adaptive radiation. To accomplish my research aims, I leverage both comparative phylogenetic methods and population genomic approaches to work at the instersection of the macroevolutionary and microevolutionary scales. </font></p>
  
<p><font size="3.5">My research covers a broad range of topics: see <u><a href="https://austinhpatton.github.io/ongoing-research/">here</a></u> for a brief discussion of my ongoing and past projects. </font></p>
