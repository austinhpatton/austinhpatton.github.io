# Research
### Bridging the gap between micro- and macro-evolution
Broadly speaking, my research is focused on the processes of hybridization, adaptation, and diversification. To study these, I leverage both comparative phylogenetic methods at the macroevolutionary scale, and population/landscape genomic approaches at the microevolutionary scale.
