<h1>Leveraging comparative genomics and phylogenetics to understand evolutionary radiations</h1>

<p><font size="3.5">I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in <u><a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~storfer/">Andrew Storfer's</a></u> lab at Washington State University. Broadly speaking, my research is focused on the processes of hybridization, adaptation, diversification and their intersection. Recently, I've become particularly interested in both adaptive and non-adaptive radiation; I intend for my future research to be directed towards these phenomena. To acomplish my research aims, I leverage both comparative phylogenetic methods at the macroevolutionary scale, and population genomic approaches at the microevolutionary scale. While these two fields often work in isolation of one-another, I believe that each will benefit much from the other. A theme in my work is the careful use of and examination of the performance of methods. </font></p>
  
<p><font size="3.5">My research covers a broad range of topics: see <u><a href="https://austinhpatton.github.io/ongoing-research/">here</a></u> for a brief discussion of my ongoing side-projects. </font></p>
