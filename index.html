<h1>Bridging the gap between micro- and macro-evolution</h1>

<p><font size="3.5">I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in <u><a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~storfer/index.html/">Andrew Storfer's</a></u> lab at Washington State University. Broadly speaking, my research is focused on the processes of hybridization, adaptation, and diversification. One central aim of my research is to neatly link these three processes. To accomplish this, I leverage both comparative phylogenetic methods at the macroevolutionary scale, and population/landscape genomic approaches at the microevolutionary scale. While these two fields often work in isolation of one-another, I believe that each will benefit much from the other.</font></p>

<p><font size="3.5">In my aim to accomplish such a synthesis, I am taking a sliding-scale approach to study the three aforementioned processes, using salamanders as a case-study. First, I am starting at the macroevolutionary scale to assess the role that hybridization plays in the diversification process. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how hybridization influences diversification rates and whether hybridization should be thought of as generative or retrogressive in regards to lineage diversification. Secondly, I aim to look more closely among three hybridizing eastern terrestrial salamanders to ask <strong>1)</strong> whether hybridization is facilitating or eroding local adaptation and <strong>2)</strong> why hybridization occurs in some locations but not others. By taking a comparative genomic approach to ask these questions, I hope to gain insight into the ecological and genomic underpinnings of reproductive isolation among these species, thus informing our understanding of the diversification process that led to the generation of this species complex.</font></p>
